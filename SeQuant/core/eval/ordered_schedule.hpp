/// std::variant<BuildStep, ScopeBlock>. That is not directly expressible:
/// \c ScopeBlock::steps must hold a sequence of \c Step (so a build
/// interleaves with child blocks in one ORDERED list, per the class doc
/// above), which means \c Step has to be at least forward-declared before \c
/// ScopeBlock; but \c std::variant requires every alternative type COMPLETE
/// at the point the variant specialization is instantiated (unlike \c
/// container::vector / \c std::vector, which the C++17 library tolerates

/// Ordered by \p mode_order (most-significant/outermost first), ties/
/// unlisted types alphabetical -- identical ranking to \c
/// build_scope_schedule's step 2.
///
/// \par 2. Per-value placement: home \c BuildStep vs. escape output
/// A value's \c CellLegality::per_axis has, by construction (see \c
/// CellLegality::per_axis's own doc comment), only \c LoopLocal, \c
/// Reduction, or \c LoopCarried entries (never the implicit \c
/// LoopInvariant). Two cases:
///   - EVERY \c per_axis entry is \c LoopLocal (this includes the empty
///     case: no batch-axis dependence at all, e.g. water-20's \c
///     I(i,i;a,a)) -- the value is a plain \c BuildStep. Its home block is
///     the depth whose accumulated (root-to-depth) TYPE SET equals \c
///     home_floor's TYPE SET (root if \c home_floor is empty), by the same
///     SET-equality rule \c build_scope_schedule's step 4 uses (an
///     unmatched/non-prefix \c home_floor falls back to root, mirroring
///     that function's existing behavior -- not "fixed" here). This value
///     gets NO \c outputs entry anywhere (see \c well_formed's single-
///     producer invariant): "Transient" (design point 4) is realized as
///     "produced by a \c BuildStep and nothing else", not as an explicit
///     \c OutputKind::Transient \c outputs record, since \c
///     well_formed::detail::collect_production_ids counts EVERY \c outputs
///     entry (regardless of \c OutputKind) as an independent production
///     site -- a \c Transient \c outputs entry alongside the \c BuildStep
///     would be flagged as double-production.
///   - AT LEAST ONE \c per_axis entry is \c Reduction or \c LoopCarried
///     ("escapes" that axis, per design point 4: \c Reduction ->
///     accumulate-summed out, \c LoopCarried -> accumulate-scattered out)
///     -- the value has NO \c BuildStep anywhere; instead it is recorded as
///     an \c outputs entry (kind \c AccumulateSum / \c AccumulateScatter)
///     of the DEEPEST such axis's block. "Deepest" is this function's
///     JUDGMENT CALL for the (untested-by-the-brief) case of a value
///     escaping MORE THAN ONE axis at its own node: the innermost escaped
///     loop is where the accumulation the value's own node performs
///     actually happens, so that block is its true production site: an
///     outer escape on a SHALLOWER axis would need this value already
///     complete before the outer loop can even close -- exactly consistent
///     with an outer accumulator reading an inner one. Ties (two \c
///     per_axis entries of the same axis TYPE, e.g. a same-space outer-
///     product's per-instance \c LoopCarried entries -- see \c
///     forced_split_axes's doc comment) resolve to the one axis TYPE they
///     both name, so there is no real tie to break.
///
/// \par 3. Topological order within a block -- a REAL topological sort
/// Each block's own \c steps interleave its \c BuildStep's (one per value
/// homed there) with, if the chain continues, ONE nested child \c
/// ScopeBlock \c Step for the next-deeper axis. These are ordered by
/// \c detail::ordered_schedule_topo_sort_steps against a per-step DEPENDENCY
/// GRAPH, not a scalar key alone (see below for why a scalar key cannot
/// suffice), reconstructed from \p rich alone -- no forest access needed:
///   - GLOBAL direct-dependency edges: for every \c OccurrenceRec of every
///     value, its \c consumer_point names the static point of its
///     structural PARENT node; resolving that point back to the value_id
///     whose OWN occurrence starts there (\c point_owner, built once up
///     front) recovers "this parent value directly reads that child value"
///     -- the exact same edges the forest itself encodes, without needing
///     the forest.
///   - Per LEVEL (one \c ScopeBlock's own \c steps list, including root),
///     each candidate step gets a \c detail::OrderedScheduleStepMeta:
///     - a \c BuildStep{v}'s \c produced = `{v}`; its \c requires_ = every
///       value_id \c v directly reads (raw, unfiltered -- irrelevant/
///       external entries are dropped by the topo-sort itself, since they
///       simply never match a LOCAL \c produced set).
///     - a nested child block's \c produced = that block's OWN top-level
///       \c outputs value_id's (what it makes visible to ITS OWN parent's
///       siblings -- its internal \c BuildStep's and any FURTHER-nested
///       child's content are never directly readable from outside it: by
///       construction, a value crossing a block boundary as an operand
///       must first have been resolved out of that axis, which is exactly
///       the escape/\c outputs case). Its \c requires_ is the FULL,
///       recursively bubbled external need of its WHOLE subtree (built
///       bottom-up alongside the block itself: \c requires_all(level) =
///       (this level's own direct needs UNION its child's already-bubbled
///       \c requires_all) MINUS \c produced_all(level), where
///       \c produced_all is everything ever produced ANYWHERE in the
///       subtree, recursively) -- so a need that is only satisfiable
///       several levels further out (e.g. a root-homed common factor
///       consumed by a value nested two axes deep) still surfaces at
///       whichever level can actually satisfy it.
///   - Ties (two ready steps with no dependency relation to each other) are
///     broken by \c tie_key ascending: a \c BuildStep's is its value's own
///     \c ValueCell::first_use; a child block's is the MIN \c first_use
///     over its own \c produced_all (deterministic, and -- though no longer
///     load-bearing for correctness, since the real edges now enforce both
///     directions -- still places a block as early as its own true
///     dependency slack allows).
///
/// A single SCALAR key alone cannot express both directions of this at
/// once: an earlier version of this function used the MIN-\c first_use
/// value itself as the sort key (not just a tie-break), which is provably
/// sound for "the block sorts before every true consumer" (see the MIN vs
/// MAX reasoning that was here, now superseded) but has NO corresponding
/// guarantee for "the block sorts after every true input it reads" -- a
/// value produced by a same-level sibling \c BuildStep (e.g. a root-homed
/// operand consumed by content nested inside a child block) could still
/// land, by raw point value, AFTER the block's MIN-derived key, silently
/// mis-ordering the schedule with no structural check to catch it. The real
