SeQuant: second quantization toolkit in C++
===========================================

# Synopsis

`SeQuant` is a framework for performing symbolic algebra designed specifically
for the algebra of second quantization in quantum many-body physics.
More abstractly it can symbolically transform and numerically
evaluate (with an appropriate external tensor backend) general
tensor algebra expressions.

# Installation

See file INSTALL.md .

# Developers

`SeQuant` is developed by the Valeev group at Virginia Tech.
