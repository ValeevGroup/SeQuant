Coupled-Cluster Class
======================

Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is one of the most accurate and widely used quantum chemistry methods for describing electron correlation in molecular systems. It represents the many-electron wavefunction using an exponential ansatz:

.. math::

   |\Psi_{\text{CC}}\rangle = e^{\hat{T}}|\Phi_0\rangle

where :math:`|\Phi_0\rangle` is a reference determinant (typically Hartree-Fock), and :math:`\hat{T}` is a cluster operator that generates excited determinants. The cluster operator is typically expanded as:

.. math::

   \hat{T} = \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2 + \hat{T}_3 + \ldots

where :math:`\hat{T}_n` generates :math:`n`-fold excited determinants. For computational tractability, the cluster operator is usually truncated. For example, CCSD includes only single and double excitations (:math:`\hat{T} = \hat{T}_1 + \hat{T}_2`).

The ``CC`` class (see :class:`sequant::mbpt::CC`) provides a convenient interface for setting up and processing CC equations using SeQuant’s symbolic algebra engine. It supports various CC formulations, including traditional, unitary, and orbital-optimized ansätze.

Overview
--------

The ``sequant::mbpt::CC`` class can be used to derive:

- Ground state amplitude equations
- λ (de-excitation) amplitude equations
- Equation-of-motion (EOM) CC equations for excited states
- Response equations for properties and perturbations

Expressions are generated in spin-orbital basis and can be post-processed using SeQuant's spin-tracing capabilities. See :ref:`cc-spin-tracing` for more details.


Ansatz Options
--------------

The ``CC`` class supports several CC ansätze through the ``CC::Ansatz`` enum (see :enum:`sequant::mbpt::CC::Ansatz`):

- ``Ansatz::T``: Traditional CC ansatz, where the wavefunction is represented as :math:`|\Psi_{\text{CC}}\rangle = e^{\hat{T}}|\Phi_0\rangle`. This is the standard approach used in most implementations.

- ``Ansatz::oT``: Orbital-optimized traditional ansatz. Singles amplitudes (:math:`\hat{T}_1`) are excluded from the cluster operator, with orbital optimization performed instead.

- ``Ansatz::U``: Unitary CC ansatz, where the wavefunction is represented as :math:`|\Psi_{\text{UCC}}\rangle = e^{\hat{T} - \hat{T}^\dagger}|\Phi_0\rangle`. Particularly useful for quantum computing applications.

- ``Ansatz::oU``: Orbital-optimized unitary ansatz, combines both unitary and orbital optimized ansätze.

Key Methods
----------

Similarity Transformation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   ExprPtr sim_tr(ExprPtr expr, size_t r);

Performs the similarity transformation of an operator. For traditional CC, this computes :math:`\bar{O} = e^{-\hat{T}} \hat{O} e^{\hat{T}}` expanded as a series of nested commutators truncated at order ``r``, where :math:`\hat{O}` is the operator to be transformed.

Ground State Amplitudes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::vector<ExprPtr> t(size_t commutator_rank = 4,
                          size_t pmax = std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max(),
                          size_t pmin = 0);

Derives the equations for the :math:`t` amplitudes (:math:`\langle \Phi_P|\bar{H}|\Phi_0 \rangle = 0`) up to specified excitation levels.

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::vector<ExprPtr> λ(size_t commutator_rank = 4);

Derives the equations for the :math:`\lambda` de-excitation amplitudes.

Coupled-Cluster Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::vector<ExprPtr> t_pt(size_t order = 1, size_t rank = 1);
   std::vector<ExprPtr> λ_pt(size_t order = 1, size_t rank = 1);

Derives perturbed amplitude equations for response theory calculations.

Equation-of-Motion Coupled-Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: cpp

   std::vector<ExprPtr> eom_r(nₚ np, nₕ nh);
   std::vector<ExprPtr> eom_l(nₚ np, nₕ nh);

Derives equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOM-CC) equations for excited states. The ``eom_r`` method generates equations for the right eigenvectors, while ``eom_l`` generates equations for the left eigenvectors.

Examples
--------

The following examples demonstrate how to use the ``CC`` class to derive CC equations for various ansätze and excitation levels.

From this point onward, assume the following namespaces are imported, and the ``sequant::Context`` is configured as shown.

Advanced Usage
-------------

Truncating the Commutator Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For traditional CC with two-body Hamiltonians, the commutator expansion is truncated at the a 4th-order. However, for unitary CC or other Hamiltonians, you may need to explicitly set the commutator rank:

.. _cc-spin-tracing:

Spin Tracing of Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Equations generated by the ``CC`` class are in spin-orbital basis. SeQuant also provides capability to transform these equations into spin-traced forms.

Make sure to include the ``<SeQuant/domain/mbpt/spin.hpp>`` header to access spin-tracing functions.
