SeQuant: Symbolic Tensor Algebra in C++
=======================================

SeQuant is a framework for performing symbolic algebra of tensors over scalar fields (regular tensors) and over operator fields (tensor operators in,
e.g., quantum many-body physics). In addition to symbolic manipulation it can numerically evaluate (with an appropriate external tensor backend)
general tensor algebra expressions.

Computer algebra systems (CAS) like SeQuant are typically implemented within generic CAS like Mathematica or Maple, or using high-level languages like
Python. In fact, version 1 of SeQuant was written in Mathematica. However, the performance of high-level languages not sufficient for practical use
cases. SeQuant is written in C++ and is designed to be as efficient as possible without loss of generality.

Developers
----------

The `Valeev Research Group (VRG) <https://valeevgroup.github.io>`_ in the Department of Chemistry at Virginia Tech kickstarted the initial design and
development of SeQuant. The ongoing development of SeQuant is driven by major
`contributions <https://github.com/ValeevGroup/SeQuant/graphs/contributors>`_ from VRG and the
`KÃ¶hn Group <https://www.itheoc.uni-stuttgart.de/research/koehn>`_ in the Department of Theoretical Chemistry at University of Stuttgart.
